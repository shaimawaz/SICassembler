# SICassembler
SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING COURSE PROJECT 
This is a project that assembles a SIC file. this SIC file is a text file that has a SIC commands and instructions.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
- Implementing an assembler for the SIC hypothetical machine.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project is a simulation to the assembler of the SIC hypothetical machine.
Students should implement both Pass1 and Pass2 of the SIC assembler language.
Your assembler should consider all the issues:
- Directives: START, END, BYTE, WORD, RESB, RESW, LTORG
- Comments: If a source line contains a period (.) in the first byte, the entire
line is treated as a comment.
- Addressing modes: Simple, Indirect
- Instruction Set: Specified in Appendix A
- Literals: literals are supported in your source code
- Errors: Your Assembler should designate the errors
You should include test files. Assume a fixed format source code with all text
written in uppercase. The output of Pass 1 is:
1. Symbol Table SYBTAB: should be displayed on the screen.
2. LOCCTR, PRGLTH, PRGNAME, ...
3. Intermediate file (.mdt): Stored on the secondary storage.
The output of Pass 2:
1. The object file (.obj)
2. The listing file (.lst)
3. List of errors if happened (duplicate labels, invalid mnemonic,
inappropriate operand...).
When your source code has a fixed format, you are committed to the following
`dimensions:
Columns: 1-8 Label
  9-9 Blank
  10-15 Operation code (or Assembler directive)
  16-16 Blank
  17-35 Operand
  36-66 Comment`
If your project does not have a GUI, then you should specify all the arguments well
to the command prompt as follow (Assuming executable version stored on the C
partition):
  `C:\> pass1 cource_file.asm intmdte_file.mdt`
  `C:\> pass2 intmdte_file.mdt output_file.obj`
Your assembler can stop execution if there are errors in Pass 1, and should indicate
its termination with appropriate messages.
